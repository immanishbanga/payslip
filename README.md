Backend Technical Test

1.	Rationale around tech choices – 
I have created project in Asp.Net MVC. As per the requirement system needs to generate pay slip on the basis of inputted employee details, I have chosen web application which seems relevant to me. I have chosen ASP.NET MVC to develop this test because this is the latest one I am currently using in my current project and worked since last 6.5 years.

2.	Assumptions –
Payment Start Date – It is mentioned to capture “Payment Start Date” in test but when I see test cases mentiond at the end of document, it seems something date period need to enter by user. So I have assumed that we need to capture any date in payment start date. Once captured, pay slip needs to be generated for that month only. There is no relevance of day of month in start date as no of days are not used in calculations but pay period will be shown on the basis of specified date.

3.	Project Link – 
Please find google drive link below for the project:
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pmc8BL15dwN2KymGkksy9R4A3MbllIB4

4.	Instructions to run – 
1.	Open project in visual studio 2017.
2.	Run project

5.	Test to validate the solution – 
Both test cases mentioned in document can be used to test the application output. 2nd test case’s output is wrong as per formula mentioned in test.
